# MAESTRO Analysis of Agentic Workflow

## 1. Mission
The system is designed to facilitate travel-related services by leveraging multiple AI agents. The primary objective is to streamline the process of booking flights, hotels, and car rentals, as well as calculating trip costs. Each agent specializes in a specific domain, such as flight search, hotel pricing, or rental car availability, and they work together to provide comprehensive travel solutions. The system aims to enhance user experience by automating complex tasks, reducing manual intervention, and ensuring efficient resource utilization.

## 2. Assets

- **Agents:**
  - BookingManager
  - FlightAgent
  - HotelAgent
  - CarRentalAgent
  - CostCalculatorAgent
  - MathGreetAgent

- **Key Tools/Functions:**
  - `FlightAgent_search_flights`: Search for flights based on origin, destination, and date.
  - `HotelAgent_get_hotel_prices`: Get hotel prices for a specific location and dates.
  - `CarRentalAgent_search_rental_cars`: Search for rental cars based on location and dates.
  - `CostCalculatorAgent_calculate_trip_cost`: Calculate the total cost of a trip based on selected options.
  - `MathGreetAgent_calculator`: Performs basic arithmetic operations.
  - `MathGreetAgent_greet`: Greets a person by name.
  - `MathGreetAgent_greet_and_calculate`: Greets a person and performs a calculation for them.

- **Data Types Being Processed:**
  - Flight information (origin, destination, date)
  - Hotel pricing and availability
  - Rental car availability and pricing
  - Trip cost details
  - User inputs for calculations and greetings

## 3. Entrypoints

- **External Entrypoints:**
  - `Start` node for each agent (e.g., BookingManager, FlightAgent, HotelAgent, CarRentalAgent, CostCalculatorAgent, MathGreetAgent)

- **Internal Entrypoints:**
  - `FlightAgent_search_flights`
  - `HotelAgent_get_hotel_prices`
  - `CarRentalAgent_search_rental_cars`
  - `CostCalculatorAgent_calculate_trip_cost`
  - `MathGreetAgent_calculator`
  - `MathGreetAgent_greet`
  - `MathGreetAgent_greet_and_calculate`

## 4. Security Controls

- **Recommended Security Controls:**
  - Access control mechanisms to restrict unauthorized access to agents and tools.
  - Input validation to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
  - Logging and monitoring to track agent interactions and detect anomalies.
  - Secure communication protocols between agents to prevent eavesdropping and data tampering.
  - Regular audits and updates to maintain compliance and security posture.

## 5. Threats

| Threat                                   | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Score |
|------------------------------------------|------------|--------|------------|
| Agent Impersonation                      | Medium     | High   | Medium-High|
| Data Poisoning                           | Medium     | High   | Medium-High|
| Denial of Service (DoS)                  | High       | Medium | Medium-High|
| Compromised Agent Registry               | Low        | High   | Medium     |
| Marketplace Manipulation                 | Medium     | Medium | Medium     |
| Model Extraction                         | Medium     | High   | Medium-High|
| Adversarial Examples                     | Medium     | Medium | Medium     |
| Input Validation Attacks                 | High       | High   | High       |
| Backdoor Attacks                         | Low        | High   | Medium     |
| Data Leakage                             | Medium     | Medium | Medium     |

## 6. Risks

The system faces several risks, including the possibility of agent impersonation, which could lead to unauthorized access and control over the system. Data poisoning poses a significant threat as it can skew the results of AI models, leading to incorrect or biased outputs. Denial of Service attacks could disrupt the availability of services, affecting user experience. Compromised agent registries and marketplace manipulation could undermine trust in the system by promoting malicious agents or hiding legitimate ones. Model extraction and adversarial examples threaten the intellectual property and reliability of AI models. Input validation attacks could lead to code injection and system compromise, while backdoor attacks could introduce hidden vulnerabilities. Data leakage risks the exposure of sensitive information, impacting privacy and confidentiality.

## 7. Operations

Agents interact at runtime through predefined workflows, with each agent responsible for specific tasks. Monitoring practices should include real-time logging of agent interactions, anomaly detection systems to identify unusual behavior, and regular audits of agent performance. Implementing redundancy and failover mechanisms can enhance resilience, ensuring continuous service availability even in the event of an attack or failure.

## 8. Recommendations

1. Implement robust access control and authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access and agent impersonation.
2. Enhance input validation across all agents to mitigate injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
3. Deploy secure communication protocols to protect data in transit between agents.
4. Establish comprehensive logging and monitoring systems to detect and respond to anomalies in real-time.
5. Regularly update and patch all components to address vulnerabilities and maintain security posture.
6. Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and mitigate potential threats.
7. Educate and train staff on security best practices to reduce the risk of human error and insider threats.
8. Develop and maintain an incident response plan to quickly address and recover from security incidents.
