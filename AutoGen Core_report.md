# MAESTRO Analysis of Agentic Workflow

## 1. Mission
The system under analysis is a multi-agent AI system designed to facilitate various aspects of travel planning and mathematical operations. The system comprises several agents, each with its unique function. The `BookingManager` is the central agent that likely coordinates the overall process. The `FlightAgent`, `HotelAgent`, and `CarRentalAgent` are responsible for searching flights, getting hotel prices, and searching rental cars, respectively. These agents are crucial in planning a trip. The `CostCalculatorAgent` calculates the total cost of a trip based on selected options. Lastly, the `MathGreetAgent` performs basic arithmetic operations and greets a person by name. This agent seems to have a different function compared to the other agents and might be used for other purposes within the system.

## 2. Assets
The key assets in the system are:

- Agents:
  - BookingManager
  - FlightAgent
  - HotelAgent
  - CarRentalAgent
  - CostCalculatorAgent
  - MathGreetAgent

- Their key tools/functions:
  - FlightAgent_search_flights
  - HotelAgent_get_hotel_prices
  - CarRentalAgent_search_rental_cars
  - CostCalculatorAgent_calculate_trip_cost
  - MathGreetAgent_calculator
  - MathGreetAgent_greet
  - MathGreetAgent_greet_and_calculate

- Data types being processed:
  - Flight details
  - Hotel prices
  - Car rental details
  - Trip cost details
  - Arithmetic operations
  - Greetings

## 3. Entrypoints
The following nodes or functions act as external entrypoints into the system:

- BookingManager
- FlightAgent
- HotelAgent
- CarRentalAgent
- CostCalculatorAgent
- MathGreetAgent

## 4. Security Controls
Based on the structure, the following security controls might be present or are recommended:

- Access Control: To restrict unauthorized access to the system.
- Input Validation: To prevent injection attacks.
- Logging: To track system activities and detect anomalies.

## 5. Threats

| Threat | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Compromise of a Higher-Level Agent | Medium | High | Medium-High |
| Communication Channel Attack | High | High | High |
| Identity Attack | High | High | High |
| Data Poisoning | Medium | High | Medium-High |
| Denial-of-Service (DoS) through Overload | Low | Medium | Low-Medium |

## 6. Risks
The system faces several risks. A compromise of a higher-level agent, such as the `BookingManager`, could lead to a system-wide disruption as the attacker could manipulate other subordinate AI agents to perform malicious tasks. Communication channel attacks could disrupt the normal functionality of the system by causing miscommunication between the AI agents. Identity attacks could lead to unauthorized access and control over AI agents. Data poisoning could lead to biased results or unintended consequences in AI decision making. Lastly, a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack could make the system unavailable to legitimate users, preventing normal function of the AI system.

## 7. Operations
The agents interact at runtime through a series of function calls. For instance, the `MathGreetAgent_greet_and_calculate` function calls the `MathGreetAgent_calculator` and `MathGreetAgent_greet` functions. Monitoring these interactions at runtime can provide valuable insights into the system's operation and help detect anomalies. Operational practices such as regular system audits, incident response planning, and continuous security training can support observability and resilience.

## 8. Recommendations
Based on the above analysis, the following security improvements or design changes are recommended:

1. Implement robust access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to the system.
2. Use secure communication protocols to prevent communication channel attacks.
3. Implement strong identity management systems to prevent identity attacks.
4. Regularly sanitize and validate data to prevent data poisoning.
5. Implement rate limiting and load balancing to prevent DoS attacks.
6. Regularly audit system activities and implement anomaly detection mechanisms to detect threats early.
7. Develop an incident response plan to handle security incidents effectively.
8. Provide continuous security training to staff to keep them updated on the latest threats and mitigation strategies.
